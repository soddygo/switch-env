# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the implementation of missing core features in the EnvSwitch CLI tool. Based on the analysis of the existing codebase and README documentation, several key features are currently implemented as placeholder functions but lack actual functionality. These features are essential for a complete environment variable configuration management tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Export Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my configurations to a file, so that I can backup my settings or share them with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `envswitch export -o configs.json` THEN the system SHALL export all configurations to the specified JSON file
2. WHEN I run `envswitch export -c config1,config2 -o partial.json` THEN the system SHALL export only the specified configurations
3. WHEN I run `envswitch export --format env -o configs.env` THEN the system SHALL export configurations in environment file format
4. WHEN I run `envswitch export --metadata --pretty` THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and descriptions with pretty formatting
5. IF no output file is specified THEN the system SHALL use default filename `envswitch_export.json`
6. IF the output directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it
7. WHEN export fails due to file permissions THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message

### Requirement 2: Configuration Import Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import configurations from a file, so that I can restore backups or use shared configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `envswitch import configs.json` THEN the system SHALL import all configurations from the JSON file
2. WHEN I run `envswitch import --merge configs.json` THEN the system SHALL merge imported configurations with existing ones
3. WHEN I run `envswitch import --force configs.json` THEN the system SHALL overwrite existing configurations with same names
4. WHEN I run `envswitch import --dry-run configs.json` THEN the system SHALL show what would be imported without making changes
5. WHEN I run `envswitch import --backup configs.json` THEN the system SHALL create a backup before importing
6. IF imported file contains invalid configurations THEN the system SHALL validate and report errors
7. IF configuration conflicts exist and no force flag is used THEN the system SHALL prompt user for resolution
8. WHEN import completes successfully THEN the system SHALL report number of imported configurations

### Requirement 3: Configuration Deletion Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete configurations I no longer need, so that I can keep my configuration list clean and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `envswitch delete myconfig` THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion
2. WHEN I run `envswitch delete myconfig --force` THEN the system SHALL delete the configuration without confirmation
3. WHEN I try to delete the active configuration THEN the system SHALL warn me and clear the active status after deletion
4. WHEN I try to delete a non-existent configuration THEN the system SHALL display an error with suggestions
5. IF deletion is cancelled by user THEN the system SHALL exit without making changes
6. WHEN deletion completes successfully THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and update the configuration file

### Requirement 4: Interactive Configuration Editing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing configurations interactively, so that I can modify environment variables without recreating the entire configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `envswitch edit myconfig` THEN the system SHALL open an interactive editor for the configuration
2. WHEN editing a configuration THEN the system SHALL display current variables and allow adding, modifying, or removing them
3. WHEN I save changes in the editor THEN the system SHALL validate the new configuration before applying
4. WHEN I try to edit a non-existent configuration THEN the system SHALL offer to create a new one
5. IF I cancel the editing session THEN the system SHALL exit without making changes
6. WHEN editing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL update the configuration with new timestamp

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and helpful suggestions when operations fail, so that I can quickly resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested solutions
2. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific issues and suggest fixes
3. WHEN import/export operations encounter conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide clear options for resolution
4. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide informative success messages with next steps
5. IF verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show detailed progress information during operations

### Requirement 6: File Format Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to import and export configurations in different formats, so that I can integrate with various tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify `--format json` THEN the system SHALL handle JSON format with full metadata
2. WHEN I specify `--format env` THEN the system SHALL handle environment file format (.env style)
3. WHEN I specify `--format yaml` THEN the system SHALL handle YAML format (basic implementation)
4. WHEN importing THEN the system SHALL auto-detect file format based on extension if format not specified
5. WHEN exporting with metadata THEN the system SHALL include creation/modification timestamps and descriptions
6. IF unsupported format is specified THEN the system SHALL display available format options
